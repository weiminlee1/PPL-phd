### DATSCAN(TM)

DATSCAN is a specialized imaging technique that allows doctors to capture detailed pictures of the dopamine neurons in your brain. this technique involves the use of a radiopharmaceutical agent (a chemical compound containing an isotope, or radioactive element). the radiopharmaceutical agent is injected into a vein and taken up by the brain's dopamine cells.  the cells can then be detected through SPECT (sing photon emission computed tomography) scanning.  in this way it is possible to determine whether there is a reduction in dopamine cells, which usually occurs in the presence of Parkinson's disease.
